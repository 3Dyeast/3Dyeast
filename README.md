- 👋 Hi, I’m @3Dyeast
- 👀 I’m interested in speeding up filament 3D printing manufacturing.
- 🌱 I’m not a programmer, just a systems analyst and designer currently learning about how to use GitHub and how to optimize 3D printing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing software support for novelty features that speed up 3D printing.
- 📫 I'll tell you later how to reach me ...
